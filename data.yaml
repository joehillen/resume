about:
  I have 13+ years of experience working at all levels of the software stack,
  including front-end, back-end, microservices, testing, database, cloud,
  infrastructure as code, and CI/CD. I'm passionate about building reliable,
  type-safe, fault-tolerant, distributed systems without over-engineering. I
  often specialize in DevOps but approach it like a software engineer.
  
  My background in DevOps and full stack development makes me a highly desirable
  candidate for Staff Engineer roles. My roles have primarily focused on DevOps,
  and I've always worked across teams and with all parts of the software stack,
  giving me a unique, holistic perspective. I love mentoring, training, and
  collaborating with cross-functional teams, users, customers, and business
  leaders. I'm motivated by improving team efficiency, polishing rough edges, and
  fixing issues that are often ignored. 

  My current favorite tools are Rust, Typescript, Deno, React, GraqhQL, Pulumi,
  Kubernetes, GitLab, Linux, and Git.

    accomplishments:
      - Primary software developer for the Infrastructure Team.
      - Developed a configuration management library in Haskell, named Craft, as
        a more versatile and type-safe alternative to Puppet and Ansible.
      - Built, with Haskell/Craft, a large-scale automated test suite to deploy
        and test Elasticsearch in 100 to 1000 node cluster configurations on AWS
        and GCP.
      - Developed, using Haskell/Craft and oauth2_proxy, a highly available
        proxy service to allow employees to give Google SSO access to
        their internal Elasticsearch clusters without installing anything,
        having any special access, knowing any secrets or asking the
        infrastructure team for help. It has a management portal and would
        automatically create custom domain names and TLS certificates.

        configuration.
      - Wrote a custom wildcard DNS service (ip.es.io) in Haskell as a highly
