      San Marcos, CA</p>
      <p>I have 13+ years of experience working at all levels of the
      software stack, including front-end, back-end, microservices,
      testing, database, cloud, infrastructure as code, and CI/CD. I’m
      passionate about building reliable, type-safe, fault-tolerant,
      distributed systems without over-engineering. I often specialize
      in DevOps but approach it like a software engineer.</p>
      <p>My background in DevOps and full stack development makes me a
      highly desirable candidate for Staff Engineer roles. My roles have
      primarily focused on DevOps, and I’ve always worked across teams
      and with all parts of the software stack, giving me a unique,
      holistic perspective. I love mentoring, training, and
      collaborating with cross-functional teams, users, customers, and
      business leaders. I’m motivated by improving team efficiency,
      polishing rough edges, and fixing issues that are often
      ignored.</p>
      <p>My current favorite tools are Rust, Typescript, Deno, React,
      GraqhQL, Pulumi, Kubernetes, GitLab, Linux, and Git.</p>
