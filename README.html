San Marcos, CA</p>
<p>13+ years of experience working at all levels of the software
stack,<br />
including front-end, back-end, microservices, testing, database,
cloud,<br />
infrastructure as code, and CI/CD. I’m passionate about building
reliable,<br />
type-safe, fault-tolerant, distributed systems without over-engineering.
I<br />
often specialize in DevOps but approach it like a software engineer.</p>
<p>My atypical background gives me a unique, holistic perspective. I’m a
strong<br />
leader that loves mentoring, training, and collaborating with<br />
cross-functional teams, users, customers, and business leaders.</p>
<p>My current favorite tools are Rust, Typescript, Deno, React, GraqhQL,
Pulumi,<br />
Kubernetes, GitLab, Linux, and Git.</p>
<p>I plan to work from home for the foreseeable future; however, I do
not mind<br />
visiting an office near the San Diego area periodically.</p>
