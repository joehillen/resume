San Marcos, CA</p>
<p>I have 13+ years of experience working at all levels of the software
stack,<br />
including front-end, back-end, microservices, testing, database,
cloud,<br />
infrastructure as code, and CI/CD. I’m passionate about building
reliable,<br />
type-safe, fault-tolerant, distributed systems without over-engineering.
I<br />
often specialize in DevOps but approach it like a software engineer.</p>
<p>My background in DevOps and full stack development makes me a
highly<br />
desirable candidate for Staff Engineer roles. My roles have primarily
focused<br />
on DevOps, and I’ve always worked across teams and with all parts of
the<br />
software stack, giving me a unique, holistic perspective. I love
mentoring,<br />
training, and collaborating with cross-functional teams, users,
customers,<br />
and business leaders. I’m motivated by improving team efficiency,
polishing<br />
rough edges, and fixing issues that are often ignored.</p>
<p>My current favorite tools are Rust, Typescript, Deno, React, GraqhQL,
Pulumi,<br />
Kubernetes, GitLab, Linux, and Git.</p>
