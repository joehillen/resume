# Resume - Joe Hillenbrand

*PDF version available [here](https://joe.h9d.org/resume/joehillen-resume.pdf)*

joehillen@gmail.com  
San Marcos, CA

I have 13+ years of experience working at all levels of the software stack,  
including front-end, back-end, microservices, testing, database, cloud,  
infrastructure as code, and CI/CD. I'm passionate about building reliable,  
type-safe, fault-tolerant, distributed systems without over-engineering. I  
often specialize in DevOps but approach it like a software engineer.  
  
My background in DevOps and full stack development makes me a highly  
desirable candidate for Staff Engineer roles. My roles have primarily focused  
on DevOps, and I've always worked across teams and with all parts of the  
software stack, giving me a unique, holistic perspective. I love mentoring,  
training, and collaborating with cross-functional teams, users, customers,  
and business leaders. I'm motivated by improving team efficiency, polishing  
rough edges, and fixing issues that are often ignored.  
  
My current favorite tools are Rust, Typescript, Deno, React, GraqhQL, Pulumi,  
Kubernetes, GitLab, Linux, and Git.
